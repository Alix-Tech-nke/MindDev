Starting with AWS can be exciting! Below are beginner-friendly projects and a roadmap to help you get hands-on experience with core AWS services. All projects use the AWS Free Tier (ensure you stay within usage limits to avoid charges).

### **Beginner Project Ideas**

#### 1\. Host a Static Website using Amazon S3

Objective: Learn to host a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript website.  
Services: Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service).  
Steps:

1. Create an S3 bucket and enable "Static Website Hosting."
    
2. Upload your website files (e.g., index.html).
    
3. Configure bucket permissions to allow public access.
    
4. Access your site via the S3 endpoint URL.
    

Learning Outcome: Basics of cloud storage, permissions, and static web hosting.

---

### **2\. Build a Serverless "Hello World" with AWS Lambda**

Objective: Run code without managing servers.  
Services: AWS Lambda, API Gateway.  
Steps:

1. Write a Lambda function (e.g., Python/Node.js) that returns "Hello World."
    
2. Create an API Gateway to trigger the Lambda function.
    
3. Test the API endpoint in your browser.
    

Learning Outcome: Serverless architecture, event-driven programming.

---

### **3\. Launch a Virtual Server with Amazon EC2**

Objective: Deploy a basic web server on a cloud instance.  
Services: EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud).  
Steps:

1. Launch an EC2 instance (use the free-tier eligible t2.micro).
    
2. SSH into the instance and install a web server (e.g., Apache/Nginx).
    
3. Host a simple webpage and access it via the instanceâ€™s public IP.
    

Learning Outcome: Virtual machines, SSH, and basic server management.

---

### **4\. Create a Database with Amazon RDS or DynamoDB**

Objective: Learn managed database services.  
Services: Amazon RDS (Relational Database) or DynamoDB (NoSQL).  
Steps:

* RDS: Deploy a MySQL/PostgreSQL instance and connect via a local client.
    
* DynamoDB: Create a table and add items using the AWS Console.
    

Learning Outcome: Managed databases, SQL/NoSQL basics.

---

### **5\. Automate Deployment with AWS Amplify or CI/CD**

Objective: Deploy code automatically using CI/CD pipelines.  
Services: AWS Amplify (for static sites) or CodePipeline/CodeDeploy.  
Steps:

1. Connect your GitHub repo to Amplify to auto-deploy a static site.
    
2. For CI/CD: Set up a pipeline to deploy code from GitHub to EC2/S3.
    

Learning Outcome: DevOps basics, automation.

## **How to Start with AWS**

#### 1\. Set Up Your AWS Account

* Sign up for the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/).
    
* Enable billing alerts in AWS Budgets to avoid unexpected costs.
    
* Never share your root account credentials. Create an IAM user with limited permissions for daily use.
    

#### **2\. Learn the Basics**

* AWS Training: Enroll in free courses like [AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials](https://aws.amazon.com/training/digital/aws-cloud-practitioner-essentials/).
    
* Hands-On Labs: Use [AWS Skill Builder](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/) or [Qwiklabs](https://www.qwiklabs.com/).
    

#### 3\. Start Small

* Begin with Project 1 (S3 Static Website). Itâ€™s the easiest and teaches core concepts.
    
* Gradually move to serverless (Lambda) and EC2 projects.
    

#### 4\. Use Infrastructure as Code (Optional)

* Learn AWS CloudFormation or Terraform to automate resource setup.
    

#### 5\. Monitor Your Work

* Use Amazon CloudWatch to track metrics and logs for your projects.

### Tips for Success

* Documentation is Key: Always refer to the [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/).
    
* Join Communities: Ask questions on [AWS Developer Forums](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/) or Redditâ€™s r/aws.
    
* Experiment: Break things in the Free Tier, then fix them!

### Next Steps

After completing these projects, explore:

* AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) for advanced serverless apps.
    
* AWS Elastic Beanstalk for PaaS (Platform as a Service).
    
* AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification to validate your skills.
    

Start small, stay curious, and build incrementally! ðŸš€
