### **1\. What is Amazon EC2 and how is it used?**

**Answer:**

Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) provides scalable virtual servers in the cloud. EC2 instances can be resized, started, and stopped based on need, making them ideal for dynamic workloads. You can launch EC2 instances via the AWS Console, CLI, or SDK.

### **2\. How do you scale an EC2 instance vertically?**

**Answer:**

Vertical scaling involves increasing the instance size (CPU, RAM) without adding more instances. You can do this by stopping the instance, modifying the instance type, and restarting it. Vertical scaling is limited by the largest instance size available.

```bash
aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute –instance-id <instance-id> –instance-type “m5.large”
```

### **3\. What are the steps to launch an EC2 instance?**

**Answer:**

* **Step 1:** Open AWS Management Console and navigate to EC2 Dashboard.
    
* **Step 2:** Click on “Launch Instance,” select an AMI (Amazon Machine Image), and choose the instance type.
    
* **Step 3:** Configure the instance details, add storage, tag the instance, configure the security group, and launch.
    

### **4\. How do you auto-scale EC2 instances?**

**Answer:**

Auto-scaling is configured using Auto Scaling Groups (ASG). First, define a launch configuration or template, set the minimum, maximum, and desired number of instances, and specify scaling policies. The ASG automatically scales the number of instances based on demand.

### **5\. What are security groups in AWS?**

**Answer:**

Security groups act as virtual firewalls for EC2 instances, controlling inbound and outbound traffic. You define rules to allow or deny traffic based on IP ranges and protocols. Security groups are stateful, meaning changes to outbound rules automatically apply to inbound traffic.

aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress –group-id &lt;group-id&gt; –protocol tcp –port 80 –cidr 0.0.0.0/0

### **6\. How does Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) help in scaling?**

**Answer:**

ELB automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances in one or more Availability Zones. It helps scale applications by ensuring traffic is directed to healthy instances, improving availability and fault tolerance.

### **7\. What is the difference between Vertical Scaling and Horizontal Scaling?**

**Answer:**

Vertical scaling involves increasing the capacity of a single instance (e.g., adding more CPU or RAM). Horizontal scaling involves adding more instances to handle load. Horizontal scaling is generally preferred for cloud applications because it’s more fault-tolerant.

### **8\. What is Amazon S3 and how can it scale?**
